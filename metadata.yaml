  A [Juju](https://juju.is/) [charm](https://juju.is/docs/olm/charmed-operators)
  deploying and managing a SAML Integrator on Kubernetes and bare metal. SAML is an XML-based
  open-standard for transferring identity data between two parties: an identity
  provider (IdP) and a service provider (SP).

  This charm simplifies configuration of SAML SPs by providing a single point
  of configuration for all the requirers using the same SAML entity. It can be
  deployed on many different Kubernetes platforms, from [MicroK8s](https://microk8s.io)
  to [Charmed Kubernetes](https://ubuntu.com/kubernetes) and public cloud Kubernetes
  offerings.

  As such, the charm makes it easy to manage and propagate SAML configuration, while
  giving the freedom to deploy on the Kubernetes platform of their choice.

  For DevOps or SRE teams this charm will make operating any charm leveraging SAML
  authentication simple and straightforward through Juju's clean interface.
